School Finder
=============

# What is it?

This project was created for a [DoSomething.org](https://www.dosomething.org/) internship code screening.

The assignment was to create a user interface that allows the user to locate nearby schools. Sample data including 10 schools was provided.

# What did I use?

For the project, I used:

- [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) (for CSS stylesheets)
- [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) (for JavaScript scripts)
- [Google's Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/) (for getting the user's latitude and longitude given the zip code and vice versa)
- [The Haversine Formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) (for calculating the shortest distance between a particular school and the user's location)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) (for auto-watching and auto-compiling SASS, CoffeeScript, and HTML files)

# How can I run it?

Simply download the repository and open `index.html`. Alternatively, visit the live site [here](http://srikarg.github.io/school-finder/)!
